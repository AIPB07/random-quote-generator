# Random quote generator
A random quote generator using React, made as a project for FreeCodeCamp's 'Front End Libraries' certification.

The app can be used with two jsx files: script.jsx or script-hooks.jsx. The only difference is the implementation, with the first using class components and the second using hooks.
